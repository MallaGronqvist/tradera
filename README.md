# Introduction
Tradera is an online platform for selling items through auction.
Traders can add item so that other user can bid for it and the winner will be able to buy the product.
Tradera Fronent allows user to use Tradera website and add new ad, view all bidding items, bid on an item and search 
for required item.
The first step was creating website prototype by using [figma](
